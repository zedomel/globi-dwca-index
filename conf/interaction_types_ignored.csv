Habitat of Biomphalaria tenagophila is tropical standing water or freshwater. Biomphalaria tenagophila is an intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni and a vector of schistosomiasis. Schistosoma mansoni came to Neotropics from Africa in context of the slave trade. Schistosoma mansoni was not able to infect Biomphalaria tenagophila in 1916 and it has adapted to this host since 1916. Experimental parasites include

it was found that much of the N. luetkeana was growing epiphytically on P. californica with their holdfasts attached to the blades and upper portions of the stipes. S latissima was also epiphytic but occupied the middle part of the stipe. Neither was present on the lower regions of the stipe and it was thought that this was due to grazing pressure from benthic macrofauna such as sea urchins.The epiphytic community of Pterygophora californica

the rather comprehensive ecological data indicates that habitat in the Faiyum region changed at the start of the Oligocene
the ratio of males to females was between 16
there are three cohorts
there are two types of movements
there is one exception
The reproductive biology of this species was studied by Silva et al. (2008)
there were other serpulids
these sponges lived throughout the marine water column.<br/><br/>File
The size of the egg is 1.5 mm.Heller J.
the species can produce occasionally 3 generations per year. They are hatching from eggs. The shape of egg cluster is rounded to oval shape even when containing more eggs. There are usually 2–15 eggs in cluster.<br/><br/>Parasites Galba truncatula is an intermediate host for these known trematodes and nematodes
The species inhabits a small area in the Western Caucasus in the vicinity of Sochi. It is known from two localities
